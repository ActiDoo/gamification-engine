The Gamification-Engine (gengine) is an open source software (MIT) for integrating any kinds of gamification features into your product.

The engine is **not meant to be a platform** including any kinds of predefined graphics, layouts or statistics.
It is framework for developing your own solution, implemented as a **service** to which your application server can talk over a REST api.

Latest recommended version: https://github.com/ActiDoo/gamification-engine/releases/latest

## Features

- multi level achievements
- multi goal achievements
- progress and single goals 
- leader boards / ladder
- achievements can be reached directly or by evaluating leaderboards daily, weekly, monthly or yearly
- time zone independent (correct daily, weekly.. evaluations among time zones)
- social-awareness (e.g. reach the highest score among your friends)
- geo-awareness (e.g. reach the highest score among all users in your city)
- rules can be defined in python using given variables (e.g. the current level)
- custom definable achievement properties and rewards
- custom definable languages and translations
- dependencies between achievements (prerequisites & postconditions)
- goals can execute triggers (currently creation of messages and mobile pushes for iOS/Android)
- high performance / scalable
- administration ui

## REST Interface

Simple REST-interface to communicate with arbitrary systems

see http://gamification-engine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/rest/index.html

## Demo Installation

A demo installation is available at https://gamification-engine.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

1. A ready-to-use buildpack for Heroku and dokku is available at https://github.com/ActiDoo/gamification-engine-dokku Follow the instructions there.
2. The current stable version is available as python package at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gamification-engine
3. Checkout the source code and configure the PostgreSQL database in `development.ini`. Then run `python setup.py develop` to configure the application, `initialize_gengine_db development.ini reset_db=True populate_demo=True` to configure the database and `pserve development.ini` to start it. The front end is available at http://localhost:6543/admin/

## Docker support (2019-12)

For development run:
 `docker-compose up`
 Go to `localhost:9000` to access admin interface or `localhost:6060` to access adminer.
 Code will be mounted into the container and server will be started with `--reload`.
 
For production deployment adapt passwords and settings in `production.ini` and `docker-compose.production.yml` and run:
 ```
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
 ```
 A production ready server will run on `localhost:9000`, login using credentials set in `docker-compose.production.yml` 

## Roadmap

Do you want to contribute? We badly need tests!
Also a nicer admin UI would be great or maybe some cool features :-)
